## BNCC Webmaster Fullstack Final Project

This is a final project for the Webmaster - Fullstack class held by BNCC (Bina Nusantara Computer Club) @BINUS Bandung. For this final project, I was asked to build a discussion forum website. This is a full-stack project, so I have to do all the works from the front-end side to the back-end side of the website.

The participants are recommended to pick any existing discussion forum website as a reference and build their project as similar as possible to the reference. In this project, I chose [KASKUS](www.kaskus.co.id), an Indonesian discussion forum website as my reference.

And the requirement for this project are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Built using Laravel 7</li>
    <li>Using Laravel 7's blade templating system, eloquent ORM, model relationship, migration, and scaffold auth</li>
    <li>Homepage: to see a list that consists of all the threads created</li>
    <li>Register and Login using Laravel's Scaffold Auth</li>
    <li>User can see their own and another user's profile</li>
    <li>See thread's detailed information with the replies</li>
    <li>Logged in users can post a reply on a thread</li>
    <li>Users can reply to another user's reply (1 level)</li>
    <li>Users can delete and edit their own replies</li>
    <li>Users can delete and edit their own threads</li>
    <li>Users can close their own thread (lock the thread so it can not be replied to anymore)</li>
    <li>Any other additional feature will be a plus point for the project's mark</li>
</ul>
